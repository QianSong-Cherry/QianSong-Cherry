<h2>Zero-shot Learning</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>    
A zero-shot learning (ZSL) method of automatic
target recognition (ATR) in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image
is proposed to address the scenario, where no SAR sample of a
particular target is available for training. To learn features of
the unseen target, physics-based electromagnetic (EM) simulated
images of the target under different azimuth angles are used
as the training data instead. The challenge lies in the fact that
the simulated image has a distinct but nonessential texture that
the real images do not have and, thus, can easily result in an
overfitted discriminator network. To overcome this problem, all
images are first preprocessed with a nonessential factor suppression
step and then fed into a pretrained convolutional neural
network for feature extraction. Finally, the feature vector is fed
into a trainable fully-connected network for classification. The
low-dimensional embedding of feature vectors suggests that the
nonessential factor suppression can align the simulated samples
with true samples effectively. We propose the max-tolerability
principle and averaged margin index for ZSL, which is a useful
indicator for selecting optimal classifier.We validated our method
on ten-type target recognition task on MSTAR data sets and
achieved 91.93% accuracy on nine known targets and 79.08%
accuracy on zero-shot target.

<h2>SAR Image Colorization</h2>
</font>
<hr>
<h3>Abstract</h3> 
Numerous radar polarimetry theories and polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) processing
methods have been developed. However, the vast majority of SAR images are not fully polarimetric
(full-pol). This paper proposes ``radar image colorization'' to reconstruct a full-pol image from a nonfull-
pol image, so that existing PolSAR methods, such as model-based decomposition and unsupervised
classification, can be directly applied to the reconstructed full-pol SAR images. It proposes to train a specially
designed deep neural network to convert a single polarization gray-scale SAR image to full-pol. It consists of
two components: a feature extractor network to extract hierarchical multi-scale spatial features of the grayscale
SAR image, followed by a feature translator network to map spatial feature to polarimetric feature
with which the polarimetric covariance matrix of each pixel can be reconstructed. Both qualitative and
quantitative experiments with real full-pol data are conducted to show the efficacy of the proposed method.
The reconstructed full-pol SAR image agrees well with the true full-pol image, not only in the sense of
visual similarity but also in the sense of real PolSAR applications, such as target decomposition and terrain
classification.
